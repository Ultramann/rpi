## Remappings

### Pattern
1. Enter programming mode: `Fn` + `R_Ctrl`. Right LED under space bar should be lit now.
2. Start reprogramming: press key you want to reprogram, "target'. Right LED under space bar should be blinking.
3. Reprogram: press the key you want the key you're reprogramming to become. Right LED under space bar should continue to blink.
   At this point, if you messed up the mapping you would wait for the second light to stop blinking and the reprogramming will be abandoned.
4. Commit new programing: press `Pn`.
5. Exit programming mode: `Fn` + `R_Ctrl`. Right LED under space bar should go out.

You don't have to perform step 5, and just repeat steps 2-4 for all your new keymappings, until after all of your programming is complete.
If you want to check if you programmed correctly you'll need to exit programming mode though, step 5, and start again at step 1 when you're done testing.

### Resetting
While in the layer you want to reset press the original `Fn` + `r` for 5 seconds. You you start the left LED under the space bar should start flashing. After 5 seconds,
when it's complete, it will stop flashing.

## My Mappings
Order matters.

Enter layer 2: `Fn` + `,`

Start programming: `Fn` + `R_Ctrl`
`Win` -> `L_Alt`: `L_Alt` then `Win` then `Pn`
`L_Ctrl` -> `Win`: `Win` then `L_Ctrl` then `Pn`
Stop programming: `Fn` + `R_Ctrl`
Move `Fn` to `L_Ctrl`:
1. Unplug keyboard
2. Turn DIP switch 4 to On
3. Plugin keyboard
4. Press `Fn` then `L_Ctrl` then `Pn`
5. Press `Pn` to leave it in the same place
6. Turn DIP switch to Off.
Start programming: `Fn` + `R_Ctrl` (Note: `Fn` is now on left side.
`Esc` -> `Caps Lock`: `Caps Lock` then `Esc` then `Pn`
`Shift + Esc` is `Backtick`: `Esc` then `Fn + Esc` then `Pn` (`Fn + Esc` is mapped to backtick on the Pok3r)
`Fn + h` is left arrow: `Fn + h` then `Fn + j` then `Pn`
`Fn + j` is down arrow: `Fn + j` then `Fn + k` then `Pn`
`Fn + k` is up arrow: `Fn + k` then `Fn + i` then `Pn`
`Fn + l` is already right arrow on Pok3r
