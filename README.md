# Raspberry Pi

My raspberry pi (rpi) is my first computer without an attached keyboard, mouse, and screen that I've had for...a decade and a half. It's forced me to go back to basics, and tbh learn many things I had taken for granted.

While I'm sure there are *many* more things to learn, this repo is a place for notes on my adventures with different operating systems and tools on/with the rpi.
