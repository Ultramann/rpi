# Arch Linux

## Installation
Followed instructions from [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-arch-linux-on-raspberry-pi/), with the only differences being I installed the most recent version of arch linux arm for rpi 4 from [here](http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz) and the name of the sd card when plugged into my rpi was not `sdb` but `sda`. So all refereces were changed accordingly.

## Wifi
`wifi-setup` not working initially, seems like I might need to use `wpa_supplicant` directly. Need more research.
